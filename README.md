# ⌚ FitBit Fitness Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of **FitBit** fitness tracker data. The goal is to transform raw digital health records into interactive visual insights that help understand user health behavior, analyzing the relationship between physical activity, calorie burn, and sleep patterns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Power BI**: The primary tool for building interactive dashboards and reports.
* **Power Query**: Used for data cleaning, handling missing values, and data transformation (ETL).
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Created custom measures and calculated columns for accurate activity metrics.
* **Data Modeling**: Developed a star schema to connect Activity, Sleep, and Weight datasets into a unified model.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Analysis
* **Activity Classification**: Categorized user days based on step counts (Very Active, Fairly Active, Lightly Active, and Sedentary) and their impact on calories.
* **Sleep Quality Analysis**: Evaluated sleep efficiency by comparing "Total Minutes Asleep" vs. "Total Time in Bed".
* **Calorie Burn Trends**: Identified the direct correlation between distance traveled and daily calorie expenditure.
* **Sedentary Behavior Tracking**: Highlighted periods of low activity to provide movement recommendations.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
* **Interactive Slicers**: Allows filtering data by Date, Activity Level, or User ID for personalized exploration.
* **UX-Optimized Design**: A clean, modern interface designed for quick decision-making and clarity.
* **Scalable Structure**: The data backend is organized to allow easy updates with new data records.

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `FitBit2.pbix`: The main Power BI project file containing all reports and data models.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download the `FitBit2.pbix` file.
2. Open it using **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Interact with the visuals using the filters and charts provided.
